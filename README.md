# FlappyBird Genetic Algorithm

This is my implementation of a flappy bird genetic algorithm using Processing3. This project was inspired by Daniel Shiffman of the Coding Train (https://github.com/CodingTrain).
You can find his implementation of this on p5.js on (https://youtu.be/c6y21FkaUqw)

# Working

This project has a basic flappy bird game layout where a bird (player) must avoid the oncoming pipes and the floor. The game is played using a player input to make the bird jump.
In this project, I used a basic 2 layer neural network along with a genetic algorithm to "teach" the bird when to jump and when not to.
